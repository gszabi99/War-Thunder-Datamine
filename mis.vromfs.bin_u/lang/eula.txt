Please note that deleting your personal information will result in the permanent deletion of your Gaijin Account. Once deleted, your account, along with any game progress and purchases, cannot be restored.

• Right to Opt-Out of Certain Processing. You may restrict Gaijin's ability to process your personal information unless we have legitimate grounds to continue processing it.

• Right to Opt-Out of Sales or Targeted Advertising. We do not engage in the traditional "selling" of your personal information, meaning we do not trade your phone numbers, email addresses, or other personal details for any compensation. However, like many companies, we may share some of your personal information with third parties to help personalize and enhance advertising on external websites or apps. In certain states, these actions might be considered a “sale” or “sharing” of personal information for targeted advertising, and as such, you have the right to opt out.

• Right to be Free from Discrimination. State privacy laws typically prevent discrimination based on your decision to exercise your privacy rights. This includes practices like offering different quality goods or services, charging different prices, or imposing penalties. We will not discriminate against you in any way if you choose to exercise your privacy rights.

• Right to Appeal. If we deny your request to exercise any of the rights mentioned above, depending on your state of residence, you may have the right to appeal our decision.

• Private Right of Action. Under the laws of some states, you may have the right to seek civil damages for violations of privacy laws, subject to certain limitations.

• To learn more about how to exercise your rights regarding your personal data, please refer to Clause 9.2 above.

7.3. All purchases made through the Service(s) are non-refundable, irrespective of the payment method, unless otherwise required by applicable law.

9. SERVICE TESTING

9. SERVICE TESTING

9.1. Gaijin may grant a User with a limited, non-transferable, non-exclusive, and revocable right to use test versions of the Service(s) to identify errors and help to improve their functionality. Participation in service testing is subject to the Terms and Conditions. The Service testing may include alpha and beta tests, including closed tests, which must remain confidential as outlined in Clause 9.3 below. Participation in the closed tests is subject to Gaijin's prior approval issued at its absolute discretion. Gaijin evaluates the decision to grant the User access to the closed test on a case-by-case basis.

9.2. Participation in service testing is free and personal. Transferring access (or the right to access) to service testing to third parties is strictly prohibited.

9.3. All information acquired and/or provided by the User during closed service testing (including, without limitation, comments, ideas, or other feedback) is strictly confidential. The User must not disclose any information about the Service(s) revealed during the closed testing phase, including but not limited to details regarding the features, functionality, gameplay, or storyline. The User must also refrain from publishing or sharing screenshots, screen recordings, or any other media containing closed Service content or disclosing errors found during the test. Additionally, streaming gameplay (or using the Service(s) in any other public manner) is prohibited during closed testing. For the avoidance of doubt, disclosure of edited, altered, or in any other way redacted information in order to circumvent abovementioned restrictions constitutes a violation of this confidentiality obligation. This confidentiality obligation remains valid indefinitely or for the longest duration permitted by applicable law, whichever is shorter. The User acknowledges that a breach of this confidentiality would cause irreparable harm, and Gaijin is entitled to seek full compensation for any damage resulting from such a violation.

9.4. Test versions of the Service(s) may be made unavailable at Gaijin’s discretion at any time, including any associated progress, achievements, In-Game items, or other data. User acknowledges that Services in testing may not work as intended, contain bugs and errors, and are provided on an "AS IS" basis. Gaijin makes no warranties regarding the Service(s) in testing, whether express or implied.

10. WARRANTY DISCLAIMER AND INDEMNIFICATION

10.1. The Service(s) are used at the User’s own risk, and the User agrees that they are solely responsible for any damage to their device, loss of data, or any other harm resulting from such activities. Gaijin does NOT provide any warranties regarding the Service(s) unless explicitly stated in these Terms and Conditions. This includes, but is not limited to, warranties of accessibility, risk-free use, suitability for a particular purpose, error-free performance, and non-harmful effects on the User’s health and well-being. Gaijin’s contractors, agents, dealers, distributors, or any third party have no authority to modify this limited warranty or offer additional warranties unless agreed upon by Gaijin in writing.

10.2. User agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Gaijin, its agents, employees, directors, successors, assignees, and licensees from any and all claims, liabilities, losses, costs, and damages (including legal fees and expenses) arising directly or indirectly from the User's conduct or violation of the Terms and Conditions.

10.3. Under no circumstances shall Gaijin or any of its affiliates be liable for any direct, indirect, consequential, punitive, special, or incidental damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of business, revenue, data, information, or business interruption) arising from, or in connection with, the use or inability to use the Service(s), content, products, services, statements or actions of any third party on or through the Service(s), unauthorized access or alteration of transmissions or data, failure to store data, loss of data, or any damage to files, content, or Service(s) available. This limitation applies even if Gaijin has been advised of the possibility of such damages. However, this limitation does not apply to liability for death or personal injury to the extent such limitation is prohibited by applicable law. Additionally, some jurisdictions do not allow or limit the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages or do not allow the exclusion or limitation of implied warranties, and thus, the above limitation may not apply in all circumstances.

11. MISCELLANEOUS

11.1. Binding Agreement. These Terms and Conditions are legally binding on all Users and constitute a written agreement between the User and Gaijin. By accessing or using the Services, the User agrees to be bound by these Terms.

11.2. Amendments. Gaijin reserves the right to update, modify, or change these Terms and Conditions at any time. When significant changes are made, Gaijin will notify the User by posting the updated Terms and Conditions on its Website(s). For material modifications, Gaijin may require the User to accept the updated Terms (if the User has an Account). Continued use of the Service(s) after such updates shall be deemed acceptance of the revised Terms and Conditions. If the User does not agree to the amendments, they must cease using the Service(s).

11.3. Assignment. User may not assign or transfer any of their rights or obligations under these Terms to any third party without Gaijin's prior written consent. Gaijin, however, reserves the right to assign, transfer, or delegate any of its rights or obligations under the Terms and Conditions, in whole or in part, to any third party at its sole discretion, without the User’s consent. In such cases, Gaijin will update the Terms and Conditions as necessary.

11.4. Severability. If any provision of these Terms and Conditions is found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of the provisions shall remain in full force and effect. The invalid or unenforceable provision shall be modified to the extent necessary to make it enforceable and reflect the original intent of the provision as closely as possible.

11.5. Entire Agreement. These Terms and Conditions, along with any documents or agreements incorporated by reference (including the Privacy Policy and EULA), constitute the entire agreement between the User and Gaijin regarding the Service(s). They supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications, representations, or agreements, whether electronic, oral, or written, between the User and Gaijin concerning the Service(s).

11.6. Force Majeure. Gaijin shall not be held liable for any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations under these Terms due to causes beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to natural disasters, war, terrorism, strikes, power outages, internet service interruptions, or government regulations.

11.7. Waiver. Failure by Gaijin to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Any waiver of any provision of these Terms shall be effective only if in writing and signed by an authorized representative of Gaijin.

8. HEALTH PRECAUTIONS

8.1. You understand and agree that the audiovisual content in the Game(s) may aggravate conditions such as epilepsy and other neurological disorders.

Gaijin is not responsible for any direct or indirect consequences that may arise from playing the Game(s) in such circumstances.

8.2. You also acknowledge that prolonged gameplay can lead to excessive fatigue, which may contribute to certain health issues, including impaired vision, spinal problems, neuroses, and other health disorders. You are solely responsible for monitoring the time spent playing our Game(s), taking regular breaks to rest, maintaining a proper posture while playing, and implementing any other necessary precautions to protect your health.

8.3. Some of our Game(s) include Virtual Reality (“VR”) features, which involve additional specific health and safety precautions. You must exercise due care at all times when using a VR headset and any related equipment or accessories (“VR Equipment”) while playing our Game(s) to ensure your safety and well-being.

BEFORE ENGAGING IN VR AND/OR USING VR EQUIPMENT WHILE PLAYING A GAME, YOU MUST CAREFULLY READ AND FOLLOW ALL SAFETY AND HEALTH PRECAUTIONS SET OUT BY GAIJIN BELOW, AS WELL AS THOSE PROVIDED BY THE MANUFACTURER OF YOUR VR EQUIPMENT. THESE MAY BE FOUND IN THE USER MANUAL, PACKAGING, WEBSITE, OR OTHER OFFICIAL SOURCES.

8.3.1. Please be aware that engaging in VR and/or using VR Equipment while playing our Game(s) involves significant risks. Failure to observe the necessary precautions—both those set by your VR Equipment’s manufacturer and those outlined below—may result in property damage, personal injury to yourself or others, and, in extremely rare cases, death.

We strongly recommend that you stop playing immediately if you experience any of the above symptoms or feel unwell while engaging in VR and/or using VR Equipment.

8.3.3. We strongly advise against engaging in VR while under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or any medical substances. If you have a pre-existing medical condition that could be affected by VR use, we recommend consulting a qualified medical professional (e.g., your physician) before using VR Equipment.

8.3.4. You acknowledge that engaging in VR and/or using VR Equipment significantly reduces your awareness of your physical surroundings, and you may have difficulty hearing or seeing what is happening around you. To minimize the risk of injury or property damage, we strongly recommend preparing your play area in advance by ensuring ample space, removing any tripping hazards such as wires or toys, and avoiding use near balconies, windows, staircases, furniture, or any objects that could cause harm or be damaged during gameplay. Additionally, adjust your audio settings to a level that allows you to remain aware of your real-world environment.

8.3.5. In no event shall Gaijin or any of its affiliates be liable for any direct, indirect, consequential, punitive, special, or incidental damages (including, without limitation, loss of business, contracts, revenue, data, information, or business interruption), under any theory of liability, arising from or related to your interaction with other people, objects, or your surroundings in your play area while engaging in VR and/or using VR Equipment to play a Game. You expressly acknowledge, assume, and accept all risks inherent in or associated with the use of VR and VR Equipment while playing a Game. While certain risks and mitigation measures have been outlined above, this list is not exhaustive. You further expressly waive any right to bring a claim or action against Gaijin arising from any harm or damage you may suffer due to failure to exercise reasonable care while engaging in VR and/or using VR Equipment.

YOU HEREBY RELEASE GAIJIN AND ITS AFFILIATES FROM ANY AND ALL LIABILITY RESULTING FROM, ARISING OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF VR AND/OR VR EQUIPMENT.

9. SYSTEM AND TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

9.1. Please note that the technical requirements outlined below may change periodically, including updates to the same Game(s). Such changes are typically driven by updates or modifications made to the Game(s) by Gaijin, as detailed in Section 10 of this EULA. However, Gaijin reserves the right to modify these requirements for any Game(s) at its sole discretion.

9.1.1. Minimum Requirements. Each Game is designed to run on specific platforms (operating systems or devices). In some instances, a Game may have minimum technical requirements for your device (such as CPU, GPU, RAM, free storage, etc.), which Gaijin will provide on the Game(s)’ official Website(s), on its page on third-party gaming platforms, or through other means at Gaijin’s discretion. It is your responsibility to ensure that your platform meets these minimum requirements. Failure to meet these requirements may prevent the Game(s) from launching or functioning correctly, and Gaijin will not be held responsible for any related issues. You are solely responsible for ensuring that your device has sufficient resources, including free RAM, storage, CPU, and GPU capacity, to store and run the Game(s).

9.1.2. Recommended Requirements. For your convenience, Gaijin may publish recommended system requirements for optimal gameplay, relating to the technical parameters of your device. Please note that these recommended requirements are provided for informational purposes only and do not guarantee flawless performance or imply any warranties. To clarify, if a specific platform (whether a device or operating system) is listed as a “recommended requirement” for a Game(s), it means the Game(s) is designed to function optimally on that platform. The same applies to other “recommended requirements” evident from the context.

9.1.3. Internet Connection Requirement. Generally, Gaijin’s Game(s) require a stable, high-speed internet connection to function correctly and provide an enjoyable gaming experience. Please be aware that Gaijin is not responsible for any issues arising from the quality of your internet connection (including speed, reliability, server availability, or “ping”).

10. PATCHES, UPDATES, AND MODIFICATIONS

10.1. To provide the highest level of Service(s), enhance user experience, and ensure the efficiency of Gaijin’s Service(s) within the Game(s), we periodically need to patch, update, and modify our Game(s). These updates may be mandatory and/or automatic. As a result, older versions of the Game(s) may not launch or function appropriately until you update to the latest version.

10.2. Gaijin reserves the right to modify the software code of the Game(s) at any time at its sole discretion. These changes may impact various Game(s) aspects, including its functionality and content. For example, we may add or remove content, introduce new features, fix bugs or errors, or make balance adjustments.

10.3. Please note that some patches, updates, and modifications may require your device to meet higher technical requirements or increase the resources consumed by the Game(s). Failing to meet these new requirements could result in decreased performance, lower graphics quality, or any other reduced settings over time.

10.4. By accepting this EULA, you acknowledge and agree that refusal to update the Game(s) may render its continued use impossible. In such cases, this EULA shall be considered suspended until the Game(s) is updated.

11. LICENSE TERMINATION

11.1. Termination by User. You may terminate this EULA at any time by permanently ceasing to use our Game(s) and deleting them from your device.

11.4. Termination by Gaijin will take effect immediately unless explicitly stated otherwise by Gaijin or required by applicable law.

11.5. License termination does not affect any obligations or liabilities of either party that have accrued before the termination.

PLEASE NOTE THAT TERMINATION OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OR THE TERMS OF SERVICE, OR SUSPENDING THIS EULA, WILL RESULT IN THE IMMEDIATE TERMINATION/SUSPENSION OF YOUR LICENSE.

12. ADDITIONAL PLATFORM TERMS

Suppose you access the Game(s) through third-party platforms. In that case, you are solely responsible for ensuring that you use such platforms and any associated accounts (such as Apple App Store, PlayStation, or Xbox) in accordance with the applicable policies of those platforms. Please review the terms of the specific platforms listed below.

Please note that third-party platforms are not responsible for any breaches of this EULA or any omissions by Gaijin. This EULA does not modify any agreements you have with third-party platforms; their terms will always take precedence over this EULA regarding the use of those platforms and their intellectual property.

Gaijin will comply with the requirements set by third-party platforms to provide access to the Game(s) through those platforms. As a result, Gaijin may need to update this EULA to align with the requirements of third-party platforms.

12.1. Apple App Store Additional Terms

The following additional terms apply to Games available on Apple Inc. devices, such as the iPhone or iPad (“Apple”):

This EULA is between you and Gaijin, not Apple. Apple has no obligations under this EULA and is not responsible for any breaches of this EULA, including issues with the Game(s)’ functionality. The usage of the Game(s) provided via Apple is subject to the Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions or the Volume Content Terms, which take precedence over this EULA.

As Clause 1.3 of this EULA states, the license granted to you is non-transferable. It is limited to the right to store the Game(s) on Apple devices you own or control and to run and display the Game(s) solely on those devices, in accordance with the Usage Rules outlined in the Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions. This includes devices you do not own but are associated with you via Family Sharing, volume purchasing, or valid contracts.

Apple is not responsible for maintenance or support for the Game(s).

Gaijin is solely responsible for any warranties related to the Game(s), whether expressed or implied by law. Apple has no warranty obligations. If the Game(s) fails to meet any applicable warranty (express or implied), you may contact Apple for a refund of the Game(s)’ purchase price.

Apple is not responsible for handling any claims related to the Game(s), including but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) claims that the Game(s) does not meet legal or regulatory requirements; or (iii) claims under consumer protection or similar laws, including those related to the Game(s)’ use of HealthKit or HomeKit frameworks.

If any third-party claims that the Game(s) infringes upon their intellectual property rights, Gaijin will be solely responsible for investigating, defending, settling, and discharging such claims, as necessary under this EULA.

You represent that you are not located in any U.S. embargoed countries, nor are you on the U.S. Treasury Department's Specially Designated Nationals list, the U.S. Department of Commerce Denied Persons list, or the Entity List.
