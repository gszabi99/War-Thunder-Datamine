The Game may offer additional paid functionality—such as in-game items, in-game currency, premium accounts, and others—that simplifies gameplay by providing additional advantages, elements, and capabilities and also expands the Game's functionality (the "Non-activated Data and Commands"). The purchase and payment for the rights to use the Non-activated Data and Commands are not necessary conditions for participating in the Game or obtaining the rights to use the Game as a whole. The rights to use the Non-activated Data and Commands are provided at your request and discretion. The Non-activated Data and Commands are integral part of the Game, are not a separate computer program, and the rights to its use can be exercised by you only in connection with the use of the Game. Rights to Non-activated Data and Commands are available for use exclusively within the Game and cannot be transferred or sold outside the Game.
3.2. Users can acquire Non-activated Data and Commands from the Publisher directly or through digital distribution platforms, partner services, or third-party platforms. Any purchases through third-party platforms such as app stores are subject to the platform’s terms and refund policies.
3.3. You agree that the Publisher has the right to change the terms and conditions for providing Non-activated Data and Commands.
3.4. In some Games, in-game currency may be awarded to the User without a fee for performing specific actions within the Game (for example, reaching a new level or completing Game tasks).
3.5. You agree to use the Non-activated Data and Commands only in accordance with this Agreement and applicable law. You may not sell, transfer, exchange, or use the Non-activated Data and Commands for illegal or prohibited purposes.
3.6. You may purchase Non-activated Data and Commands using real money and other payment methods (if provided by the functionality of the respective Game). Once the Publisher receives payment confirmation from the system, the Non-activated Data and Commands are considered purchased. All sales are final, and the items cannot be refunded, exchanged, or transferred.
3.7. The price of some Non-activated Data and Commands, including in-game items, may be indicated in virtual in-game currency. Please note that such virtual currency, consisting of software code and audiovisual elements integrated into the Game, does not constitute real money. The Publisher sets the exchange rate between virtual and real currency, displayed in the in-game store. Please note that the store is a feature of the Game and is not intended for financial trading.
3.8. Non-activated Data and Commands may have an expiration date or other restrictions the Publisher sets. If not used within a specified period, they may be canceled without notice and without compensation.
3.9. The Publisher reserves the right to change or remove any rights to Non-activated Data and Commands from the Game at its discretion without prior notice. In the event of termination or modification of the rights to Non-activated Data and Commands for any reason, the Publisher does not provide refunds or compensation for the respective rights to Non-activated Data and Commands, as specified in clause 8.1 of the Agreement below.

You agree that the Publisher does not exchange purchased Non-activated Data and Commands (for example, in-game currency or in-game items) for cash or non-cash items, does not compensate your expenses, in particular, for any User transactions, and does not pay interest on the use of funds, as Non-activated Data and Commands are an additional feature of the Game, and their payment is a fee for a license to use extended Game functionality. You are not allowed to purchase Non-activated Data and Commands (for example, in-game currency) from third parties not authorized by the Publisher.
3.12. Only the Publisher and authorized persons can provide all Non-activated Data and Commands. If a User accesses paid features from unauthorized third parties, the Publisher can block their access, fix any issues caused by using these features, and end the Agreement with the User.
3.13. When a User obtains Non-activated Data and Commands due to a technical error, malfunction, incomplete payment, or without using in-game currency, the Publisher can deduct the cost from future payments or block (restrict) the User's Account.
3.14. The User shall bear all costs associated with transferring funds when purchasing rights to Non-activated Data and Commands, including any fees.
